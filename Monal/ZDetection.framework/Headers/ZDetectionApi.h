ZDetection is the main interface point for controlling threat monitoring. For most use cases, simply calling detectCriticalThreatsWithCallback: will be sufficient, along with shutdownZIAPEngine if it is desirable to stop monitoring at some point.
 
 The callback should include code to remove any sensitive data or take other actions to protect the user. These actions would be specific to your own application and use cases.
 
 Objective C:
 <pre>
 #import \<ZDetection/ZDetection.h\>

     // Do some action to protect the user here, such as:
        [session logout];
 }];

 Swift:
 <pre>
 import ZDetection
 ZDetection.detectCriticalThreats { (ZThreat) in
     print(ZThreat!)
     // Do some action to protect the user here, such as:
